  * orl anl and company - want to have a bitmask to be
    used to write to the memory registers in a bitmapped
    (bitmasked) way.

    Primitive might be: read the address, do the masking
    outside the register (do it locally on the virtual
    stack) and write the result back to the address.

    The idea is to preserve whatever the register already
    had, and to set or clear a single bit (where required).

  * PORTC_0  through  PORTC_3  -  make operational, in eForth .S sourcefile

  * TX/RX pair mapping to Adafruit board's SCL/SDA

        PORTB_6 is USART1_TX  I2C1_SCL
        PORTB_7 is USART1_RX  I2C1_SDA

  * Format README.md so that it wraps as it is meant to.

END.
