The RPi, breadboarded C8051F330D, and the STM32F405
(or 407 Discovery) are all riding on a chassis,
together.

The RPi is connected to HDMI display and USB keyboard.
In one mode, this subsystem acts as the terminal
(running picoterm or a python serial widget program)
to talk directly to the STM32 chip via its TX/RX pair
(USART) (one of them).
