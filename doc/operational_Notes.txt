USB Connections

The project calls for two USB connections to the host PC.

One is for Trinket M0, acting as a kind of serial terminal
for the STM32F405 target (which communicates on its SDA/SCL
pair, but pinmuxed to be an USART; therefore could have been
silcscreened as TX/RX instead of SDA/SCL (or swapped; not
documented here which is the operational case ;)

The other is the USB-C connection to the STM32F405 itself.

The two (together) constitute the only power routes to the
project (overall) -- each has its own 5VDC source (via their
respective USB cables).
