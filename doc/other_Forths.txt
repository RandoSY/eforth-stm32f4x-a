  ColorForth

    Howerd (@uk) ported ColorForth to a USB booting/saving
    config, which does run on Via Epia (ML600 possibly; has
    the cle266 foo part in it).  It crashes very often,
    though seems to be highly deterministic (be very careful
    when rubbing out words to clear a copied block; maybe
    other crashes).  Reliable enough to experiment with,
    however.
