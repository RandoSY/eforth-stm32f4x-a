  PORTC_0  D8_NEOPIX
  PORTC_1  D13 LED
  PORTC_2  D12
  PORTC_3  D11

These four GPIO pins are to be supported in eForth.

eForth currenly maps PORTD_12 through PORTD_15.

Those are not present on the Adafruit board (they
are present on the STM32F407 Discovery board, and
operate four of the LED's there).
