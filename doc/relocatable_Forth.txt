The plan:

Construct .hex output program in Forth, on the
STM32F405 target running eForth.

Construct the simplest possible TX/RX USART setup
program, in support of the target USART within the
F405 (use the TX/RX labeled pins for this).

Construct a simple echo loop (pseudo text interpreter II)
using the new USART, in eForth.

Do that in a way that can be used as a .bin upload
(dfu-util) to another STM32F405 device (or this one,
at a new location in memory).

Since dfu-util does not zap old programs that were stored
in high flashROM space, it should be possible to have
two entirely independent images on flashROM, but in
different sectors.  Probably go above the first 16k;
maybe above the first 24k (save three sectors for the
first eForth - the main one at this juncture; using the
fourth sector for the new Forth primitive).
