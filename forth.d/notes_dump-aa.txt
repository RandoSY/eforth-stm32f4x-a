The DUMP word already provides what the Intel HEX format
provides, in terms of binary digits encoded as hex.

What it's missing is the control information (all of that)
except addressing, which is probably very close already,
or just right.

Since (all of) that is the case, copying the DUMP function
to a new word, and adding the enhancements, should be an
achievable task.

In this manner, the target should be able to generate its
own code image, to be replicated on another target -- or on
the same target, in a subsequent iteration of

    'dfu-util ./this.bin'

after a hex2bin type of util is made use of, to convert it
back into a .bin file.

The 'hex2bin' stand-in (above) is more correctly:

    arm-none-eabi-objcopy -I ihex -O binary thisfile.hex thisfile.bin
